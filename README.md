# Simple Generative AI App with Document Retrieval


This project demonstrates the creation of a simple generative AI application that can retrieve and process information from a webpage using OpenAI embeddings, vector databases (FAISS), and a retriever.

 

## Features
### Basic steps

1)Webpage Loader: Loads content from a given webpage URL.

2)Recursive Text Splitter: Splits the webpage content into manageable chunks for embedding.

3)OpenAI Embeddings: Transforms text chunks into vector embeddings for semantic search.

4)FAISS Vector Database: Stores the embeddings for efficient retrieval.

5)Retriever: Queries the vector database for relevant documents based on a user question.


## Running the App
After setting up the retriever and FAISS, you can run the app to retrieve relevant information from the webpage content.
